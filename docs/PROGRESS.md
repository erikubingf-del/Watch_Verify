# Progress Report: Advanced WhatsApp Agent

## 1. Research Phase (Complete)
- [x] Cloned and analyzed `humanlayer/12-factor-agents`
- [x] Cloned and analyzed `ai-that-works` (Advanced Context Engineering)
- [x] Extracted key architectural patterns:
    - **12-Factor Principles**: Tool calls, Context Ownership, Unified State, Control Flow.
    - **Context Engineering**: Structured formats (XML/YAML), compaction, and error handling.
    - **Phased Execution**: Research -> Plan -> Implement workflow.

## 2. Architecture Design (In Progress)
- [ ] Defining the "Agentic Loop" structure based on Factor 8.
- [ ] Designing the "Context Window" format based on Factor 3.
- [ ] Planning the "Unified State" schema based on Factor 5.

## 3. Implementation Planning (Pending)
- [ ] Create `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- [ ] Define the folder structure
- [ ] Select libraries and tools (LangChain vs. Custom, Pydantic, etc.)
